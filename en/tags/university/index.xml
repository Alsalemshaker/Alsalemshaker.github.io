      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-august-22-to-august-28&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week from August 22 to August 28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week turned out to be a transitional one. The first orientation lectures took place, along with introductory classes in mathematics and programming.&lt;br&gt;
Getting to know my group went smoothly â€” we discussed upcoming assignments and shared expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond studies, I joined a student IT community where peers work on projects and take part in hackathons. This is both inspiring and motivating, pushing me to improve my skills faster.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-august-15-to-august-21&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week from August 15 to August 21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week was marked by organizational meetings. We received our class schedule, got acquainted with the deanâ€™s office, and learned about upcoming faculty events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight was a tour of the RUDN campus. We were shown laboratories, computer classrooms, and the library. It felt clear that many opportunities for growth lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
