      <title>First Steps in Computer Science</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-my-first-impressions&#34;&gt;📌 My First Impressions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The start of my studies in &lt;em&gt;Computer Science&lt;/em&gt; has been very intense.&lt;br&gt;
From the very first month, we immersed ourselves in mathematics, the basics of algorithmization, and programming.&lt;br&gt;
It’s especially fascinating to see how abstract formulas from linear algebra find application in real computations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-programming-practice&#34;&gt;💻 Programming Practice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first assignments in &lt;strong&gt;C++&lt;/strong&gt; taught me patience: sometimes compiler errors take more time to fix than writing the code itself.&lt;br&gt;
But it is precisely through such tasks that understanding of program structure and algorithm logic comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, we began learning &lt;strong&gt;Python&lt;/strong&gt;. This language felt more “friendly” for beginners, while still being just as powerful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-life-at-rudn&#34;&gt;🌍 Life at RUDN&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the advantages of the university, in my opinion, is its international atmosphere.&lt;br&gt;
Communicating with students from different countries broadens my horizons and allows me to learn how IT is studied in other parts of the world.&lt;br&gt;
We are already discussing joint projects and sharing experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-goals-and-plans&#34;&gt;🚀 Goals and Plans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Build a strong foundation in algorithms and data structures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Actively participate in student IT clubs and hackathons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare my first small projects to showcase on GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start building a portfolio and sharing my progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-conclusion&#34;&gt;✨ Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer science is a path that requires persistence, but every small victory motivates me to keep moving forward.&lt;br&gt;
I am confident that this is where the foundation for future research and projects is being laid.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fourth Week of August — Adapting to Student Life</title>
      <link>https://alsalemshaker.github.io/en/post/04/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-august-22-to-august-28&#34;&gt;📌 Week from August 22 to August 28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week turned out to be a transitional one. The first orientation lectures took place, along with introductory classes in mathematics and programming.&lt;br&gt;
Getting to know my group went smoothly — we discussed upcoming assignments and shared expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond studies, I joined a student IT community where peers work on projects and take part in hackathons. This is both inspiring and motivating, pushing me to improve my skills faster.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Third Week of August — First Meetings and Schedule</title>
      <link>https://alsalemshaker.github.io/en/post/03/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-august-15-to-august-21&#34;&gt;📌 Week from August 15 to August 21&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week was marked by organizational meetings. We received our class schedule, got acquainted with the dean’s office, and learned about upcoming faculty events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight was a tour of the RUDN campus. We were shown laboratories, computer classrooms, and the library. It felt clear that many opportunities for growth lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>First Week of August — Student Holidays</title>
      <link>https://alsalemshaker.github.io/en/post/01/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-august-1-to-august-7&#34;&gt;📌 Week from August 1 to August 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first week of August went by in the spirit of summer holidays. Most students are still enjoying their break, but the anticipation of the upcoming academic year is already in the air.&lt;br&gt;
I used this time to finish reading a book on algorithms and practiced a bit of C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also spent time walking around Moscow, exploring the city and its cultural landmarks. In the evenings, I watched lectures on YouTube about computer science — I want to enter September feeling more prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
