      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-august-22-to-august-28&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week from August 22 to August 28&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week turned out to be a transitional one. The first orientation lectures took place, along with introductory classes in mathematics and programming.&lt;br&gt;
Getting to know my group went smoothly â€” we discussed upcoming assignments and shared expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond studies, I joined a student IT community where peers work on projects and take part in hackathons. This is both inspiring and motivating, pushing me to improve my skills faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week was marked by organizational meetings. We received our class schedule, got acquainted with the deanâ€™s office, and learned about upcoming faculty events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highlight was a tour of the RUDN campus. We were shown laboratories, computer classrooms, and the library. It felt clear that many opportunities for growth lie ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-august-8-to-august-14&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week from August 8 to August 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although classes havenâ€™t started yet, the atmosphere already feels academic. I bought the necessary notebooks, pens, and upgraded my laptop to be ready for programming and online lectures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week passed in a calm rhythm: I studied English to better understand technical texts.&lt;br&gt;
In addition, I took part in a student football tournament organized by the community. It was a great way to meet future classmates.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-august-1-to-august-7&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week from August 1 to August 7&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first week of August went by in the spirit of summer holidays. Most students are still enjoying their break, but the anticipation of the upcoming academic year is already in the air.&lt;br&gt;
I used this time to finish reading a book on algorithms and practiced a bit of C++.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also spent time walking around Moscow, exploring the city and its cultural landmarks. In the evenings, I watched lectures on YouTube about computer science â€” I want to enter September feeling more prepared.&lt;/p&gt;
